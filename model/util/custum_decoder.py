'''Since a melspectrogram sequence is much longer than its corresponding phoneme sequence, in order to solve the problem of length mismatch between the two sequences, FastSpeech adopts a length regulator that up-samples the phoneme sequence according to the phoneme duration (i.e., the number of mel-spectrograms that each phoneme corresponds to) to match the length of the mel-spectrogram sequence. The regulator is built on a phoneme duration predictor, which predicts the duration of each phoneme.
由于melspectrogram序列比其对应的音素序列长得多，为了解决两个序列之间长度不匹配的问题，FastSpeech采用长度调节器，根据音素持续时间（即，音素数量）对音素序列进行上采样。每个音素对应的mel谱图，以匹配mel谱图序列的长度。调节器建立在音素持续时间预测器上，预测器预测每个音素的持续时间。'''
